# Plan

1. Read [VIIRS 350m paper](./Schroeder_et_al_2014b_RSE-1.pdf) paper. Understand what's and which filters captures pixel lums. Do I convert this to Kelvin through an equation? Is this what's the paper is about?
2. What can you do with non-fire background? Continue your though process at [thermal detection documentation analysis](./analysis/thermal-anomalies-detection.md#other-fire-detection-approaches)
3. Understand convex and concave in Python, in our case with our data. Try to genenare them, again.
